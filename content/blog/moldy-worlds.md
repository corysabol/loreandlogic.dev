Rot comes for all things. From that rot is born life anew.

Life feeds on previous life.

# Building a Moldy, Rotten World

What does any of this have to do with world building?
Everything, actually. All of my favorite fictional worlds are moldy.
What do I mean when I say 'moldy'? Well, I'm talking about a world built upon the decay of itself.

Think about exploring the ruins of a long lost, great civilization. It's an archelogical dream.
It's intoxicating to try to interpret the plethora of details left behind by the forbears of a world.

One of my favorite things in games is to simply explore and feed my sense of wonder.
