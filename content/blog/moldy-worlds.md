Rot comes for all things. From that rot is born life anew.

**todo some cool art**

Life feeds on previous life.

# What is a 'Moldy World'

todo: define 'Modly World'
  - refer to curious archive video and any other sources that align with this idea

I think of a moldy world as having the all or some of the following characteristics:

- Physical decay
- Cultural decay
- Environmental changes
- Lost knowledge
- Misinterpreted history, past technology, etc

The world as it exists now is resting on top of the remnants of past civilizations.
Often these past civilizations were far more grand and advanced than the current one.
The new moldy world feed on the corpse of the the past worlds.

I often find that this creates a sense of regret, mourning, but also of wonder and curiosity.
Moldy worlds compell me to explore and to question for the sake of it.

Some of my favorite games of all times could be characterized as having a moldy world.

- Elden Ring
- Armored Core 6
- Dark Souls
- Shadow of the Colossus
- Rain World
- Journey
- Outer Wilds

This list could go on for a long time, so I'll stop here. I hope you get the idea.

> Wow, a lot of From Software in that list, huh?

# Building a Moldy, Rotten, Interesting World

What does any of this have to do with world building?
Everything, actually. All of my favorite fictional worlds are moldy.
What do I mean when I say 'moldy'? Well, I'm talking about a world built upon the decay of itself.

Think about exploring the ruins of a long lost, great civilization. It's an archelogical dream.
It's intoxicating to try to interpret the plethora of details left behind by the forbears of a world.

One of my favorite things in games is to simply explore and feed my sense of wonder.
