Lore is a minimalist text editor designed specifically for world builders and writers. It uses AI to intelligently organize your files and discover connections between concepts, allowing you to focus purely on writing.

## Features

- Clean, distraction-free writing interface
- AI-powered automatic organization and tagging
- Smart concept linking and relationship mapping
- Built-in version control and history
- Markdown support with live preview
- Focus on content over structure

## Philosophy

Lore embraces the idea that world building and writing should flow naturally. Rather than forcing writers to maintain complex hierarchies and relationships manually, it leverages AI to handle the organizational overhead automatically.

The editor gets out of your way while you write, then works behind the scenes to:

- Detect key concepts, characters, and places
- Build relationship graphs between ideas
- Suggest relevant connections
- Maintain a searchable knowledge base
- Track changes and versions

Let's build worlds together, one story at a time.
